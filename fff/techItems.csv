1,Mobile Framework,React Native,"- an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook, used to develop applications for Android, iOS and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities
- React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript
- you don't have to build the same application for iOS and Android, separately as React Native allows your developers to reuse the common logic layer
- the working principles of React Native are virtually identical to React except that React Native does not manipulate the DOM via the Virtual DOM. It runs in a background process (which interprets the JavaScript written by the developers) directly on the end-device and communicates with the native platform via a serialisation, asynchronous and batched Bridge",$rank=4.1;$quick=a popular JavaScript framework for building mobile apps;$todo=worth learning,2019-05-20 15:04:44,systemUnknown
2,JavaScript Framework,React,"- developed 2013 by Facebook
- a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- is not a complete application framework like Angular, it is just a view layer
- React itself is not a framework, you need to add extra stuff to make it shine
- React by itself doesn’t do all the pieces, instead, it intends to be bolted onto an existing stack
- **React abstracts away the DOM from you, giving a simpler programming model and better performance**

- concepts
	- React Suspense
		- lazy loading components is the only use case supported by React.Suspense
	- Time Slicing
		- the most awaited feature in version 17
			- expected to hugely improve performance and demand little attention on the development side
			- slices the computations of updates for children components during the callback, therefore their rendering can be spread over time
		- React Suspense and Time Slicing are about optimizing heavy workloads for slow devices
		- React 17 along with Time Slice and Suspense API
	- concurrent mode
		- a change in how React schedules updates to your UI
	- React Async
		- You can find it as react-async on npm.
		- React Async uses the React Context API to pass data down to the helper components
	- [React Fire](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13525)
		- an effort to modernize React DOM
		- many of the polyfills in React are unnecessary for modern browsers, and some of them create more issues than they solve
		- to make React better aligned with how the DOM works
		- at this stage, the project is very exploratory
- Redux
	- ""I’ve been a fan of Redux in the past mostly for its functional style, it tends to be too much for your average application. It’s a steep learning curve and quite a bit of boilerplate, but most of all it distances the data fetching from the data presentation. I like to keep things simple, so I went back to the basics: **local setState**.""
		- common place to perform data fetching in a React component is in the componentDidMount lifecycle method. Just run fetch and use setState to store the result
	- Redux Thunk 
		- a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object. That function receives the store's dispatch method, which is then used to dispatch regular synchronous actions inside the body of the function once the asynchronous operations have completed.19 juin 2018

		- Razor syntax is what you find in `.cshtml` pages, which are used in both ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Razor Pages
		- an ASP.NET template markup syntax based on the C# programming language that enables the programmer to use an HTML construction workflow
		- the design reduces the number of characters and keystrokes, and enables a more fluid coding workflow by not requiring explicitly denoted server blocks within the HTML code
	- **Razor Pages**
		- 2017: Razor Pages were first introduced with ASP.NET Core 2.0
		- the new ASP.NET Core Razor Pages is the next evolution of ASP.NET WebForms
		- a Razor page not only has a Razor view (`.cshtml` file) but also a tightly-integrated ""code-behind"" file (`.cshtml.cs` file) which defines the functionality for that page
		- Razor Pages doesn't use controllers
		- Razor Pages automatically implement antiforgery validation, which protects against cross-site request forgery (XSRF/CSRF) attacks, without using the [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] attribute		
- note when you create an ASP.NET Core Project in Visual Studio 2019, you have two choices:
	- Web Application = **ASP.NET Razor Pages** project

44,Programming Language,Java,"- created 1995 as a class-based, object-oriented language to write applications
- compiled to bytecode and so was able to run on multiple operating systems
- syntax similar to C and C++
	- but had a garbage collector which made memory management easier
- Java is a popular language for devices, e.g. the Android mobile phone

	- 2018-09: Java 11
		- Neu in Java 11 ist, dass man nun auch Lambda-Parameter mit var deklarieren kann. 
			- `Consumer<String> printer = (var s) -> System.out.println(s);`
		- Java 11 was the last LTS (Long Term Support) which is supported for three years
	- 2019-03: Java 12
		- auf den ersten Blick sieht es nicht so viel aus
		- die Idee der halbjährlichen Releasezyklen ist es, dass neue Features parallel und ohne Zeitdruck, unabhängig von den nächsten Veröffentlichungsterminen entwickelt werden können
		- changes in Switch statement
		- new bench-marking tools
	- 2019-09: Java 13
		- die größte Änderung in Java 13 ist das Ersetzen des Schlüsselworts break in der Switch Expression durch yield
		- new memory management capabilities
		- in 2020-09, `java -version` showed: *java version ""13.0.1"" 2019-10-15*

- a JavaScript compiler and configurable transpiler
- allows software developers to write source code in a preferred programming language or markup language and have it translated by Babel into JavaScript
	- e.g. you can use Babel to convert JSX markup into JavaScript using the Babel preset ""react""
- a popular tool for using the newest features of the JavaScript programming language
- Babel's main purpose is to turn unsupported or cutting-edge language features into ES5

46,Package Manager,npm,"- 2010 created
- package manager for JavaScript
- default package manager for node.js
- inspiration from shortcomings of PEAR and CPAN
- makes finding, downloading, installing and using various JavaScript libraries much easier than before
- npm started out managing node.js modules (that's why packages go into node_modules by default), but it works for the front-end too when combined with Browserify or WebPack
- [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b)
	- where npm makes it easy to install and manage dependencies hosted on the registry, npx **makes it easy to use CLI tools and other executables hosted on the registry**
	- trend is to install tools as project-local devDependencies, instead of requiring users to install them globally
		- tools like mocha, grunt, and bower, which were once primarily installed globally on a system, can now have their versions managed on a per-project basis
		- e.g. `npx mocha` is all you need to do to use your local installation
		- calling `npx <command>` when <command> isn’t already in your $PATH will automatically install a package with that name from the npm registry for you, and invoke it
			- the installed package won’t be anywhere in your globals
	- tools like *yeoman* or *create-react-app* are not used frequently
		- by the time you run them again, they’ll already be far out of date
		- with npx you don't have to install them every time you want to use them

47,Package Manager,Bower,"- a package manager, like npm, which manages frameworks, libraries, assets, and utilities, installs them, and makes sure they are up to date
- traditionally, many web development projects combined npm and Bower. npm was used to manage back-end dependencies, while Bower was used for front-end dependencies, in fact, you needed to use npm in order to install Bower in the first place
- Dec 2017: ""**Bower is dead, long live npm. And Yarn. And webpack.**""
	- Bower has been deprecated by its creators
	- Bower offered a flat dependency graph, which you can now get with NPM and Yarn

- became the de facto JavaScript library for many years, altough after 2012 or so began to be replaced by more sophisticated JavaScript libraries such as Angular, React, and Vue.js
	- it's main drawback is that it works directly with the DOM whereas the newer libraries offer more sophisticated event-based patterns such as MVVM which maintain state on the page and continually update based on a data source, and so enable a developer to make much more sophisticated and robust, easy-to-maintain web applications

- a very popular, pragmatic and universal programming language for websites, the P in the very popular LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- PHP is loosely typed which means it does not require you to declare a variable type when declaring a variable, unlike C# and Java
- 2005 added object-oriented features 
	- after 2005 when PHP5 was released, it began to be taken more seriously since the new object-oriented features gave it the ability to implement more sophisticated OOP programming paradigms as one can in C# and Java-like

- based on MVVM
- Ember.js is a part of a complete front-end stack, which comprises Ember CLI, Ember Data, Ember Inspector, Fastboot, and Liquid Fire. This allows developers to create beautifully rendered, dynamic SPAs
- consists of five key concepts: routes, models, templates, components, services

- Mithril is pragmatic, in [this 10 minute guide](https://mithril.js.org/index.html), you learn how to create components, XHR and routing, and that's just about the right amount of knowledge needed to build useful applications
- if you're starting something new, do consider giving Mithril a try, if nothing else, to see how much value Mithril adopters have been getting out of 8kb (gzipped) of code.
- ""Hyperscript, which I thought I would hate, turned out to be one of my favorite parts of using Mithril especially when I paired it with Tailwind CSS. Since Hyperscript is pure JavaScript, doesn't require a build step, and is the standard way of writing Mithril components, integrating Mithril into our legacy JS app was absolutely dead simple.""","$rank=2.8; $quick=an interesting, small JavaScript framework for single-page applications; $todo=try this out on a new project at some point",2019-06-17 16:14:19,systemUnknown

- a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device
- it has become a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion
- allows many devices on a private network to share a single gateway to the internet
	- all of those devices will have the same public IP address—that of the gateway—and unique private IP addresses
	- e.g. all of the devices connected to a NAT-enabled wifi router have different private IP addresses, but share the router’s public IP address
- the router tracks basic data about each active connection (particularly the destination address and port), when a reply returns to the router, it uses the connection tracking data it stored during the outbound phase to determine the private address on the internal network to which to forward the reply
- **IP masquerading**: Computers and servers on the internet can only see the public IP address of the router and none of the private IP addresses of specific devices, like phones, laptops, smart TVs, internet-of-things devices, and game consoles

166,Web Developer Tools,build tools,"- npm scripts (package manager)
	- entries in the scripts field of the package.json
	- learn: [Three Things You Didn't Know You Could Do with npm Scripts](https://www.twilio.com/blog/npm-scripts)
- Webpack (module loader / bundler)
	- Will Stern: ""the definitive bundler of 2019 although HTTP/2 is becoming better""
		- Let’s start with a myth about HTTP/2: With HTTP/2 you don’t need to bundle your modules anymore. HTTP/2 can multiplex all your modules over the same connection in parallel. So there are no additional round trips for the many requests. Each module can be separately cached. Sadly it’s not that easy in reality.
	- can bundle CommonJS, ECMAScript and AMD modules
		- **AMD** (define) = takes a browser approach, no knowledge of file i/o
			-  implemented by Dojo Toolkit and RequireJS
		- **CommonJS** (require, export) = takes a backend approach
		-  **UMD** (Universal Module Definition) is a variant paradigm that takes advantage of the commonalities to support both AMD and CommonJS
		- **ES6** (import/export) = 2015
	- can be installed with npm or yarn
- Rollup (ES module bundler)
	- Rollup has support for relative paths, whereas webpack does not, so we either use path. resolve or path.
	- webpack was started in 2012 by Tobias Koppers to solve a hard problem that existing tools didn’t address: building complex single-page applications (SPAs).
		- Rollup was created for a different reason: to build flat distributables of JavaScript libraries as efficiently as possible, taking advantage of the ingenious design of ES2015 modules.
	- Use webpack for apps, and Rollup for libraries
	- similar to Browserify but bundles ECMAScript modules instead of CommonJS ones)
- Parcel (module bundler)
	- is drastically simpler than Webpack, love it for non-complex work
	- can replace create-react-app
- Grunt (task runner)
	- pros
		- Huge ecosystem of plugins
	- cons
		- Can become complicated as the configuration grows
		- Lack of flexibility with uncommon tasks
		- gradually becoming outdated
- Gulp (task runner)
	- Eighteen months after Grunt, GulpJS was released
	- where GruntJS uses configuration objects to define tasks declaratively, Gulp defines them as JavaScript functions
	- It builds on top of the piping concepts (sources, filters, sinks), similar to Unix operating systems.
	- pros
		- Requires less amount of code, comparing to Grunt
		- Large ecosystem of Gulp plugins
	- con: Initially streams and promises are hard to understand
- Yarn (package manager)
	- can be used as an alternative to npm
	- is a node.js package
	- if you are a heavy user, it can be a good idea to look into Yarn that takes pride in ultrafast build times
	- speeds up the build process by caching every package so that you don’t have to download your dependencies multiple times
- Browserify (module loader / bundler)
	- node.js package
	- bundle your front-end dependencies and load them as a **single JavaScript file** in the user’s browser
	- package managers such as npm and Yarn load modules on the server-side using **Node.js’ require() function** (CommonJS) designed for loading modules. Browserify brings the require() method (CommonJS) to the client-side, which can result in a huge performance gain
	- your user’s browser has to load only one static JavaScript file that contains all the dependencies your project relies on
	- you can only use it to load Node.js modules but not other types of JavaScript (or other) files.",$idCode=buildTools;$rank=3.5;$quick=tools that accelerate web development,2020-04-17 14:14:12,systemUnknown

195,javascriptModules,JavaScript modules,"- Pre-ES2015 (ES6), the most widely used approach to adding various library modules to JavaScript files' scope was via CommonJS. Node.js uses it, and it's the system used by most packages on npm today. The main concept in CommonJS modules is a function called require. When you call this with the module name of a dependency, it makes sure the module is loaded and returns its interface to be used in the file's scope.
- For a long while, CommonJS modules worked quite well and allowed the JavaScript community, via npm, to share code on a large scale.
- But CommonJS has a few quirks that make it a less than ideal solution: namely, the fact that require is a normal function call taking any kind of argument, not just a string literal, which makes it hard to determine the dependencies of a module without running its code. 
- ES2015 introduced its own module system, and in doing so, integrated the new module support notation into the language. The main concepts of dependencies and interfaces remain the same, but the details differ.
- import carTires from './autoParts/tires.js';
- import carTires, * as tireOptions from './autoParts/tires.js';
- import { carrots, potatoes, onions } from './plants/veggies.js';
- let vehicles = await import('./waysToTravel.js');
- pro ES6/import over CommonJS/require
	- You can use named imports to selectively load only the pieces you need. That can save memory.
	- Import can be asynchronous (and in the current ES6 Module Loader, it in fact is) and can perform a little better.
- RequireJS
	- optimized for in-browser use
	- but can be used in Rhino and Node
	- current version: 2.3.6 (27. August 2018)
	- in 2015, the time has come to move on from RequireJS to Browserify or Webpack
- UMD
	- 2014
		- Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) has gained traction on the frontend, with RequireJS being the most popular implementation
		- CommonJS is a style you may be familiar with if you're written anything in Node (which uses a slight variant). 
			- var $ = require('jquery');
		- UMD is admittedly ugly, but is both AMD and CommonJS compatible, as well as supporting the old-style “global” variable definition
	- Webpack is an attempt to unify the modules landscape by supporting AMD, CommonJS and ES6 modules
	- The UMD pattern typically attempts to offer compatibility with the most popular script loaders of the day (e.g RequireJS amongst others). In many cases it uses AMD as a base, with special-casing added to handle CommonJS compatibility.
- 2017
	- In September 2017, Node.js added support for ES modules, alongside CommonJS modules, with the release of Node.js 8.5, using the .mjs (Micheal Jackson Script) extension to differentiate ES modules from CommonJS modules.
	- TypeScript cannot transpile to .mjs files.
		- Workaround: Transpile to ES2015 target, and use a post compile script to rename the files to .mjs from .js
	- TypeScript cannot import .mjs files.	
		- Workaround: There is none. Unfortunately you can’t do it today. You can import .ts files written with ES2015 syntax though.
	- TypeScript allows the use of CommonJS require() and ES module import syntax in the same module. Node.js does not.
		- Workaround: Ensure any TypeScript you write only uses ES module syntax. You should rewrite any instances of require() syntax to use import() syntax.",$rank=4.3; $quick=the method to separate code in JavaScript applications,2020-09-27 15:46:57,systemUnknown
