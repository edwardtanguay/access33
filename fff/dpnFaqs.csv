1,Why does Datapod use the file-based database SQLite instead of a more robust database such as MySQL?,"Because an important characteristic of Datapod is to be 100% portable, i.e. the complete website should be able to be packed into a .zip file, sent via e-mail, and unpacked on some other computer be it Windows, Mac or Linux, and it will run without installing or setting up an external database server. A future feature will be a data abstraction layer which will make it possible to determine the datasource at the site level, but at the ItemType level. DataSources will include not only SQLite and MySQL, but text files (in easy-to-read-and-record Datapod Item format), Excel files (to enable data entry for non-technical people), and also XML and JSON for data exchange purposes, e.g. for other applications which read the data. 

 In addition, each ItemType will be able to have multiple datasources, so for one ItemType, you can have some items in an SQL database, some in a text file, and some in an Excel file.", Data Sources, 4.7,,2019-08-15 09:30:52,systemUnknown
2,What does the folder `qtools` stand for?,"It stands for Quick Tools and is simply a collection of categorized helper functions, the categories being **qstr** (string functions), **qfil** (file functions), **qdat** (date functions), etc. So when you are programming and you need a file function, simply type `qfil.` and you will get a dropdown of all the available functions for files. The front end has similar functions available to it in `qtools.js`.",Coding,4.2,,2019-08-15 09:30:52,systemUnknown
3,"I have an ItemType that has a DataType ""line"" and now need to be able to enter more 255 characters in it, but the validation won't allow it.","In the plural class file, change the DataType from `line` to `longLine`. The form input field will be the same (an input box instead of a larger textarea), but it will allow any length string.",Forms,2.8,,2019-08-15 09:30:52,systemUnknown
