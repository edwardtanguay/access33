1,databases,Databases,"There are two kinds of databases: **SQL-based** and **NOSQL-based**, SQL being table-based and NOSQL key/document/graph-based. 

**SQL** itself is a standard created in 1974 and has set various standards since, e.g. SQL-92. Every SQL database follows more or less standard SQL for its basic commands, but also has supplemental syntax, features, functions, and idiosyncrasies. **MySQL** is the most popular and universal, **SQL Server** is the database you'll use in .NET projects, **PostgreSQL** is an alternative to MySQL, and **SQLite** is a simple and quite robust file-based database which is used in devices, for testing and for easy portability.

**NoSQL** is a group of databases which store not based on tables as in SQL but as key/values, documents, or graphs. The terms became popular around 2009 when companies needed to store and access extremely large amounts of distributed data. **MongoDB** is the most well known among NoSQL Databases, **Cassandra** is second most popular, created by Facebook and also used by companies such as Twitter for extremely large amounts of data. **Redis** is the most popular key/value store, and **CouchDB** is popular as a JSON data store which uses JavaScript as its query language.

2,operatingSystems,Operating Systems,"There are basically three operating systems that you'll use as a front-end developer today: **Windows**, **Linux** and **macOS** (Apple). 

On Windows, there is a distinction between server and client versions, e.g. it's typical to use **Windows 10** to develop but you upload your code to a **Windows Server 2012**, also it is equally typical to develop on a **macOS** or e.g. **Ubuntu** Linux system.","windows, macos, linux, bsd, ubuntu, debian, linuxMint, unix",show,$categories=/mem/,20,2019-06-12 11:27:27,systemUnknown

4,javascriptFrameworks,JavaScript Frameworks,"In 2019, there are three leading JavaScript frameworks: **React**, **Angular**, and **Vue.js**. All of the others are more or less useful but are less full-featured and thus are today less popular than these three dominant frameworks. Having deep skills in one of these three is a necessity for any web developer today, and having some experience in all three as well as others is very useful.

**Node.js** and **jQuery** are also very important to learn although they different in kind: Node.js is a backend runtime environment which enables you to create console applications and web servers written in JavaScript, whereas jQuery is also a frontend JavaScript frontend as the others in the section, but it is much older (2006) and while surpassed by the other frameworks, has become ubiquitous in real-world applications and so is important to learn as well.","react, angular, vuejs, node, jquery, ember, meteor, mithril, polymer, aurelia, backbone, knockout",show,$categories=/mem/,15,2019-06-13 15:33:30,systemUnknown
5,programmingLanguages,Programming Languages,"In order to secure employment, if you only learn one language well, learn **JavaScript** (ECMAScript), as you can used it today on the frontend and the backend (Node.js), and after that learn the backend languages **PHP**, **C#**, and **Java**. And if you are doing a lot of JavaScript work, then learn **TypeScript** as well.
