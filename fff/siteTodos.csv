15,refactoring,Make item/object/record nomenclature consistent on frontend and backend,"	- i.e. ""item"" will not be used on the frontend anymore
	- frontend: it will always get e.g. howtoRecords and will be: v-for=""object in howToObjects""
	- by ""item"" and ""items"" is always meant the class item or items itself
		- the class ""items"" has a collection of objects
		- howtoObjects means an array of item objects
		- howtos means the class which contains the array of item objects
		- howtoRecords means an array of item records stright from the database
	- or simply keep it the way it is and document it, e.g.	
		- backend itemObjects (e.g. howtoObjects) get flattened into frontend items (e.g. v-for=""item in howtoItems), i.e. have their flat data but not the methods to call
		- if you send something to the frontend that is not a rich item or collection of items, then it should be called a record, e.g. v-for=""record in infoRecords""
		- or perhaps we need a new word that refers to a flat time on the front end, e.g. 
			- unit, howtoUnit
			- fitem = flatitem
			- or flitem
			- or monad, e.g. howtoMonads
			- or thing, e.g. howtoThings
			- or flatitem, e.g. howtoFlatitem
			- or flat, e.g. howtoFlats
			- or ding, e.g. howtoDing
	- or (the way it is), simply understand that bits of information that arrive from the backend onto the front end are called ""item"" and ""items"" e.g. v-for=""item in howtoItems"", and allHowtoItems and filteredHowtoItems
	- to example this, use this example:
		-----------------------------------------
		const allSearchObjects = [];
		const object = {
			id: 1,
			idCode: 'nnn',
			title: 'This is the title.',
			searchText: function () {
				return this.title + '|' + this.idCode;
